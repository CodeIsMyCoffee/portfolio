    <h2>Here is some stuff about me!</h2>
    <p>My name is Thomas but I like to be called Tommy. I was born on July 31st. My Favorite number is 31 and my favorite color is orange.</p>
    <p>I have many hobbies that I like to do including Drawing and Writing stories, 
        I also like to code websites for no reason at all except that it is fun.
         My goal for the future is to get a job that pays well and that I like I guess and 
         that is pretty much what I want to do in the future.</p>
